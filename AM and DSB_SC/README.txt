This project implements Amplitude Modulation (AM ) and Double-Side Band Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC) modulation scheme for 

(1) a sine wave as message signal of given frequency
(2) speech signal recorded at 8KHz using matlab tools

The demodultor schemes both coherent for AM & DSB-SC and Envelope Detector for AM have also been implemented.

Code Files:

lab3.m :  Contains the code for AM and DSB-SC modulation schemes implemented for a sine wave as message signal. Also contains the code for plotting the output of envelope detector

lab33.m:  Contains the code for recording a speech signal  and plotting it.


All the graphs generated in the excercise have been included as jpg files.
