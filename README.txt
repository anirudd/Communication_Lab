This project contains lab assignments on Digital and Analog Communication. The following assignments have been included in this project:

1. AM and DSB_SC: Implements Amplitude Modulation and Double Side Band Suppressed Carrier analog modulation schemes. Also implements coherent demodulation and Envelope Detector.

2. AWGN_channel: simulates an AWGN channel. Also simulates the effect of Inter-Symbol Inteference (ISI).

3. Differential_Coding:  Implements Differential Coding scheme to compress an image file.

4. Filters: Implements low pass and band-pass filters for signals.

5. Mutiple AM Signals: Implements AM for 5 speech signals and passes all of them simultaneously through a channel. Also implements Coherent Demodulation of the 5 mixed AM signals. Time Division mutiplexing of the 5 speech signals has also been implemented.

6. Speech_Signal_Analysis :  Implements filters for speech signals and performs analysis in frequency and time domain.


All the codes have been implemented in Matlab R2012b.
