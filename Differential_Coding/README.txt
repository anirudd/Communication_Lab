This project implements differential coding scheme for the image file "lena.pgm". "lena.pgm" is the standard file used in many image processing applications.

Here differential coding has been employed to compress the image file by taking the difference of current pixel value from the previous pixel value.

"compressed.dat" is the compressed image.

"data.dat" is an intermediate file that can be deleted safely.

"read me.docx"  file includes information on running the code and the outputs returned by it. The code has been implemented in matlab.

Program File: "diff_coding.m"
