This project implements low pass and bandpass filters for given cut-off and pass frequencies. The code generates 5 sinusoids and then passes them through

(a) a low pass filter of cut off frequency: 70 Hz.
(b) a bandpass filter with pass band frequencies from 80 Hz to 100 Hz.

Program File: "lab1.m"

To run the code type the following command on the Matlab command window:

[ a,t,ftemp ] = lab1(  )

a: contains the frequencies of which sinusoids have been generated in the code
t: the time interval
ftemp: the fft of the input signal consisting of the sum of 5 sinusoids
