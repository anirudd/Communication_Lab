This project takes 5 speech signals that have been recorded at a sampling frequency of 8KHz, mixes them and then demodulates them through coherent demodulation. This project also implements Time Division Multiplexing for the 5 speech signals used earlier for AM.

A summary of the graphs along with description has been provided in "lab-4 report.pdf".

Indivisual graphs with description has been provided as jpg files.
